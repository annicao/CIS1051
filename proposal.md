# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Racing

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A python program that shows some players in a racing game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There are two players in the racing game. Each of them will be set a character. They will be controlled by AI and human. The goal is to see who is the first one to get to the destination. Then the screen will show the winner's picture.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game can be played.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The project operates as I planned.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The project works very well and has improved as I program it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to find some pictures and sounds to have a basic set up.
